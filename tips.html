                Why should I breastfeed my baby?
            </div>
            <div class="content active">
                <p class="transition visible">
                <p>As a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Lactation Consultant, I recommend that infants breastfeed for at least the first year of life, and possibly into the second and third years for optimal development and/or for as long as mutually desired by both mother and baby. For the first six months of life, the healthy infant needs no food or fluid other than breast milk. Beyond that age, mother’s milk should be increasingly supplemented with solid food and other fluids. Once you decide to start solids I would be happy to help you plan menus for your baby and advise you on how to keep breastfeeding.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most important advantage to breastfeeding is that breast milk provides an infant with significant protection against chronic diseases such as allergies and asthma; as well as infectious diseases such as meningitis, diarrhea, ear infections, and pneumonia. The immune components of breast milk constantly change to meet the infant’s need to be protected against new infections. This immune protection lasts for years beyond the child’s breastfeeding period.</p>
                <p>Breastfeeding also benefits the mother by reducing her risk of developing ovarian cancer, premenopausal breast cancer, osteoporosis, and hip fractures in later life. Breastfeeding facilitates bonding between a mother and infant that is emotionally satisfying to both participants. Through the breastfeeding experience the mother learns about her baby’s cues and she develops nurturing behaviors. Overall, breast milk is “species specific”  and nature's best food for young babies.</p>

                Getting your baby to latch onto the breast.

                    Getting Your Baby to Latch onto the Breast
                <p>Good posture is essential. Be sure to sit up straight. Try feeding on a dining room chair versus the sofa. Place pillows or folded blankets under the baby.  Consider the purchase of the My Breast Friend pillow. The baby's hips need to be almost as high as the baby's head. This will help keep the baby's jaw relaxed to latch without pinching your nipple. As your baby gets older you may not need this support, but it is very important at first. A footstool is also very helpful to elevate your feet.</p>

                <p>Hold your baby close to you. The baby's ear, shoulder and hip should be in a straight line. Forming the letter “C” with your hand to hold and support the breast. Hold your breast in one hand, positioned by your rib cage, with your fingers underneath and thumb on top.  Have your hand back from the areola (the dark skin around the nipple). Your hand should not get in the way as the baby latches on. The baby needs to get the nipple far back in the mouth to feed so milk can flow easily. Make sure that your fingers underneath your breast are not blocking the areola under the nipple. This is the MAJOR CAUSE OF CRACKED AND BRUISED NIPPLES!!</p>

                <p>Line up the baby's lips with your nipple. Touch the lips with your nipple until the baby's mouth opens wide. The baby is looking for something to suck. This is called rooting. Pull the baby quickly onto the breast aiming the nipple towards the roof and back of the mouth.</p>

                <p>Once the baby starts sucking, you will feel a tug on your nipple. It should not hurt after the first few sucks. If it hurts place your finger in the baby's mouth between the gums and remove your nipple from the baby’s mouth. Make sure the baby's mouth is wide open and the tongue is down before the baby latches on again. It is okay to start over several times. It is important to insist that your baby latches properly to avoid pain.

                <p>The first few feedings may go more smoothly if a nurse or support person applies steady, gentle pressure to the baby’s head and helps the mother by opening the baby’s mouth as he/she goes onto the breast. If your baby is not latching properly by the 2nd to 3rd day of life you need the support of a lactation consultant.</p>

                Breastfeeding Latch and Positioning
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>There are different ways you can hold your baby when breastfeeding. Choose the position that is most comfortable for you. If you have a c-section, you will probably want to use the football hold or lie down to nurse at first. That will keep the baby off your c-section incision.  Make sure your have plenty of pillows both small and large to help support and comfort you and the baby during breastfeeding sessions. The first few feedings may go more smoothly if a nurse or support person applies steady, gentle pressure to the baby’s head and helps the mother by opening the baby’s mouth as he goes onto the breast.</p>
                <p>Cross-Cradle Hold</p>
                <p>Cradle the baby in your arm, his stomach against yours. The baby's head will be resting in the bend of your elbow. The baby's whole body is facing you, tummy-to-tummy. Use your other hand forming the letter “C” to hold and support the breast.</p>
                <p>Lying Down</p>
                <p>Lie down on your side and pull the baby close to you so that you are facing each other. Some mothers place a pillow or rolled-up towel against the baby's back to keep the baby in position. A pillow behind your back may make you more comfortable. Help the baby latch on to the breast closest to the bed.</p>
                <p>Football Hold</p>
                <p>Place a pillow or two at your side to raise the baby to the level of your breast. Put the baby on the pillow with her bottom and legs touching the back of the chair (like the letter "L").Hold your baby's shoulders in the palm of your hand supporting the base of the baby's head. Use your other hand to form the letter “C” to hold and support under the breast to keep it in the baby's mouth.</p>
